// there are two fractals here. f0 is a simple rotation which spawns f1 at each iteration
// f1 creates a fractal 'tree' with 3 branches. The center branch of each iteration draws a 
// triangular graphic with a center line. There are less lines as the circle is completed because
// there are less iterations for the trees. One addition the the NFSF could be to 'reset' the 
// iteration counter so the trees could have the same number of iterations in each.
